My name is Sébastien Roch and I am a software developer based in Zürich, Switerland.
I focus mainly on frontend and single page applications, sometimes using frameworks, sometimes not.

I am the author of the following projects:
- <a href="https://www.turbogist.com">Turbogist</a>, a tool to manage your gists
- <a href="https://www.senior-shop.ch">Senior Shop</a>, a swiss online shop for elderly
- <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.offline_locator.free&hl=fr">Offline Locator</a>, an android app to retrieve a location when you have no internet (abroad for example)
- <a href="https://www.personaldisplay.net">Personal Display</a>, an application for tablet targeted at people suffering from Alzheimer disease and Dementia
