title: Apply a slight shadow when container is scrolled like Gmail
---
This little effect is part of the all the little details that make your page more pleasant and intutitive for your users.


We want to achieve this  

Let's say you have a `div` with `overflow: auto`, so that if the content overflows the div, scrollbars appear.
Applying a slight shadow at the top of the div hints the user that there is more content available.
